Goal : Test if possible to displace a component in another div of the page

Problem : Site is using Contact Form 7 on Wordpress and uses a dedicated "page" for its Privacy policy
Easy to get the PP content on the form page but not in a convenient place.

So Flow is 
1. load form
2. load PP from its dedicated page
3. displace the PP content to a more convenient place.
